            <h2>Award/Task Creator</h2>
            <p>Many students struggle to decide which assignment to work on for their classes. In this feature, you can submit tasks, and they will be listed for you. When you're ready to choose a task, it will randomly select one from the list in a dynamic display and then finalize the selection for you. Once you complete a task, it will show that you have finished it. After you complete a certain number of tasks, an icon will appear to award you for your work.</p>
